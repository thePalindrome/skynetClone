You'll either spawn as MSDOS or GNU/Linux, requiring you to pick up
cygwin/wine to get the full suite of programs (maybe have a bias towards
programs you get first depending on your OS?)

Different networks, accessible from special bridge machines

Possibly different "active exploits", memory scanning, file handle detection,
etc, to locate interesting or useful things?
